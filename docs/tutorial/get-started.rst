Welcome to Launchpad! If you're here because you've just created your Launchpad account, here are some suggestions for what you might want to do next:

* `Edit your Launchpad profile page <https://launchpad.net/people/+me/+edit>`_ -- add a photo, tell the world about yourself  
* Read the `Launchpad user guide <https://help.launchpad.net/>`_  
* `Find projects to work with <https://launchpad.net/projects>`_

What you can do with Launchpad
------------------------------

Launchpad is a hosting and collaboration service for software projects. You can use Launchpad to:

* report and learn more about bugs in software you use - `more about Bugs <https://help.launchpad.net/Bugs>`_  
* help translate software - `more about Translations <https://help.launchpad.net/Translations>`_  
* host, share and find code  
* ask for help with software - `more about Answers <https://help.launchpad.net/Answers>`_  
* plan, assign and follow the progress of chunks of work `more about Blueprint <https://help.launchpad.net/Blueprint>`_  
* create and host Ubuntu packages - `more about Personal Package Archives <https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA>`_.

You can also `register your software project <https://help.launchpad.net/Projects/Registering>`_ in our directory, then pick and choose which parts of Launchpad you want to use. It's free for `free software projects <https://help.launchpad.net/Legal#Project_eligibility>`_ - `contact us <https://help.launchpad.net/Feedback>`_ if your project uses a non-free licence.

Want to try Launchpad?
----------------------

Try Launchpad in our `staging environment <https://staging.launchpad.net>`_ without worrying about touching real data. Staging uses a copy of Launchpad's real database and gets wiped at the end of every week.

Before you can use staging, you'll need to `register your account <https://help.launchpad.net/YourAccount/Registering>`_ in Launchpad's `production environment <https://launchpad.net>`_ and then wait up to one day for your account to be copied over to staging.

.. note::
   Some features aren't automatically active on staging, including:

* translation imports and automatic approval  
* translation exports.

If you need to try these features on staging, `ask us <https://answers.launchpad.net/launchpad>`_.
